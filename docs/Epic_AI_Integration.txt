Epic: AI Integration
Epic Title: AI-Powered Learning Assistance
Epic Description:
This epic focuses on integrating AI functionality into the app to provide personalized learning assistance for students. The AI will be able to generate questions, provide summaries, highlight key points from lectures, and explain complex concepts in multiple ways. The goal is to make studying more interactive and adaptive to each student's needs.

User Stories
User Story 1: As a student, I want to see an AI assistant (like a Siri-type circle) on the CoursePage, so I can interact with it for study help.

Priority: High
Acceptance Criteria:
A clickable Siri-type circle is available on the CoursePage.
Clicking on the circle opens a chat interface where students can interact with the AI.
The AI assistant is visually accessible and always present on the CoursePage.

Priority: High
Acceptance Criteria:
The student can ask the AI to generate questions based on specific lectures (e.g., "Give me questions based on the lecture 'Name of the lecture'").
The AI has access to the lectures uploaded after each session.
The AI generates questions in multiple forms: multiple choice, open-ended questions, etc.
The AI evaluates the student's answers and provides feedback.

User Story 3: As a student, I want the AI to provide summaries of lecture material, so I can quickly review the most important points.

Priority: Medium

Priority: High
Acceptance Criteria:
The AI provides tailored explanations for complex topics.
The student can ask the AI to re-explain the topic in simpler terms or using different methods (e.g., analogies, diagrams, step-by-step breakdowns).
The AI continues to provide different explanations until the student indicates understanding.

User Story 6: As a student, I want the AI to track the questions Iâ€™ve answered and identify areas of improvement, so I can focus on my weak points.

Priority: Medium
Acceptance Criteria:
The AI tracks student performance based on the questions answered.
The AI identifies areas where the student is struggling and suggests focused study material or additional questions.
The student receives a progress report highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
